## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  #gridContainer
  {
     display:grid;
    
     grid-template-areas: 'daniel daniel jonathan kira' 
                            'jeanette patrick patrick kira';
    grid-auto-columns: 265px;
    grid-auto-columns: 280px;
     column-gap:30px;
     gap: 10px;
     background-color: #EDF2F8; 
     border:2px solid none;
     width:1220px;
    height:570px;
     margin:auto auto;
     column-gap: 30px;
     row-gap:25px;
  }
}
```


### Continued development

This project is my first project which I created using "CSS Grid".
And I will practice CSS Grid in my upcoming projects
